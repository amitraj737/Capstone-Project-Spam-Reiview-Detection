# Capstone-Project-Spam-Reiview-Detection
We all know that in this age of fast communication and digitisation, voice of customers has gained immense importance. All products displayed on the online shopping shelf have user ratings and user reviews. These Customer reviews have a great influence on the potential buyers of the products. A number of false reviews may drive the influence either to a positive direction or to a negative direction. Hence reviews can be an important catalyst in increasing or decreasing the product revenue. Any of these cases may make the customers take wrong decisions and the trustworthiness of the online opinions may be an issue. In this project we investigate opinion spam in reviews. This problem is different to email spam classification. Email spam usually refers to unsolicited commercial advertisements to attract people towards some products or services and hence they usually contain some prominent features. In comparison, this problem is more challenging because untruthful opinion spam is much harder to deal with as these kinds of spam can be carefully crafted and made indistinguishable. We shall try to identify fake reviews from a bunch of reviews based on their characteristics and also using a classification machine learning algorithm. This shall help the online retailers to filter out the spam and only the genuine ones will be displayed based on the product merit.
